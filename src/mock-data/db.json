Buchla's Algebraic Processor, Model 257 and 281 changed the way music synthesizers utilize control voltages. MATHS continues this great tradition - sculpting the voltages we use to sculpt sounds."

      "description": "In its basic form, the E340 is a two-output wavetable VCO that generates 16 waveforms at once. Modular users quickly discover that in order to get large, fat notes, multiple oscillators are needed that are slightly detuned. This can get expensive quickly, and then you have to deal with the tracking differences, additional mults for the cables, and mixers for the outputs. The E340 combines all of these, eliminates the tracking errors, and adds the added dimension of being able to control just how buzzy the cloud can go. If spread and chaos are set to 0, the E340 behaves like a standard analog vco, but with a very pure sinewave output (less than 0.3% THD) and a standard sawtooth wave."
